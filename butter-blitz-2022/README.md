# Butter Blitz (2022)
NodeCG graphics bundle used for the first Butter Blitz speedrun marathon. Based on [nicnacnic/speedcontrol-layouts](https://github.com/nicnacnic/speedcontrol-layouts) release v1.3.7.

## Requirements
- [NodeCG](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg)
- [NodeCG Speedcontrol](https://github.com/speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol) (please use the build branch)

Additionally, although not required, some basic knowledge of Javascript, HTML and CSS will make it easier to customize these layouts to your liking.

## Installation
Copy this folder to your NodeCG `bundles` folder, then run `nodecg install` from inside this folder. After the installation is complete, type `nodecg defaultconfig butter-blitz-2022` to generate the config file.

Now you're ready to customize! For guidance, the [wiki](https://github.com/nicnacnic/speedcontrol-layouts/wiki) has everything covered!

## Usage
Use this layout pack as you normally would use a NodeCG graphic. Included are many layouts with many configurations, including 4:3 and 16:9 (from 1p to 4p), GB, GBA, DS, 3DS, intermission, interview, and a customizable omnibar. Photoshop files are also included for easy editing, from simply changing the colors to rearranging elements in your layout. They can be found in `<path_to_nodecg>/bundles/speedcontrol-layouts/graphics/img/photoshop`.

If you end up using speedcontrol-layouts during your marathon/event, it would be greatly appreciated if you included the repository name and author in your end credits. Thank you!

## Special Thanks
nicnacnic, for standardizing the base graphics bundle for this.
